## About Me

Hello :wave:

My name is Travis.

I am a dedicated data engineering and analytics professional with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. Throughout my career, I have specialized in designing and implementing end-to-end data pipelines, integrating sources ranging from MySQL and Oracle databases to cloud services like Azure Data Factory and AWS Data Services. My background also includes managing complex data warehousing projects, leveraging Power BI and Tableau for visualization, and optimizing data models to support real-time reporting. 

In my most recent role as Lead Data Engineer, I guided a team responsible for building and automating critical reporting solutions for areas such as revenue cycle management and workforce forecasting. This work involved creating Operational Data Stores (ODS), cleansing and organizing large data sets through stored procedures, and orchestrating Agile development sprints to continuously enhance our analytics framework. I take pride in my ability to integrate systems, standardize data, and empower business stakeholders with the dashboards and insights they need to make timely, data-driven decisions. 

Beyond these technical accomplishments, I am driven by a philosophy of continuous improvement and collaboration. I have partnered with cross-functional teams—from finance to clinical operations—to understand their goals, identify key metrics, and develop custom solutions that optimize performance. Whether leading an Agile stand-up meeting, troubleshooting complex SQL queries, or training colleagues on best practices, I strive to be a resourceful team player who bridges the gap between technology and business. Ultimately, my mission is to leverage data in a way that boosts efficiency, innovation, and strategic growth across the clients I serve.
