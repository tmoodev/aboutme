## About Me

Hello :wave:

My name is Travis.

Data Analysis ðŸ“Š has been a regular part of my career over the past 10 years. As a Program Manager, I was responsible for using student outcome data to coach faculty behavior in 1:1 and group settings. As the Director of Continuous Improvement, I was responsible for planning and building the data infrastructure responsible for managing year over year growth over 300% and the ability to track projects from marketing lead to technical support. In my previous account manager roles and retail management roles, I was responsible for using data to make decisions that impacted an organizations bottom line. 

In 2019, I decided to wrap my existing knowledge up with a degree in Data Management and Analytics; an excellent skills-based degree to enhance my MBA and Marketing degrees. I am currently finishing up my Capstone and expect to graduate in August, 2021. This degree includes extensive study and work in SQL, Python, R, and Tableau and includes a number of certifications including CIW- Data Analyst and the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree. Course work included projects that touched on various types of databases, data ingestion, cleaning, storage, and analysis. Upon completion of my degree, I plan to complete the Oracle SQL Database PL/SQL Developer and SQL Database Administrator certifications.

My newly developed skills have given me the opportunity to bridge the gap between the layoff in my previous role (6/30/2021) with financial-based projects. I am currently developing statement automation and Tableau reports for clients for a Business Management firm and have developed a keen interest in applying Data Science practices to a number of industries.

I'd love to hear from you. Please send me a message!
